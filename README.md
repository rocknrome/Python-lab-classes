# Classes Lab in Second Language

------

## Directions (make sure to test your code as you go)

- Create a Cat class
- At instantiation you can pass a name and age to the cat constructor
- The cat has a meow method (should print "meow" to the console)
- Create a child class called Cheshire that inherits from cat
- Override the meow method in cheshire to say "Meow and a Grin"
- Create a new class called Wonderland
- Give wonderland a static method, MadHatters, that prints "No Cat here"
- Give wonderland a static method, QueenOfHearts, that prints "No Cat Here"
- Give wonderland a static method, tree, that prints "Found the Cheshire Cat" and returns a new instance of Cheshire
